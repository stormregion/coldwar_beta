Work in Progress.
There will/should be added a "Powered by Gepard" logo later...

NOTE: Due to GitHub's 100mb limit thing, you can get Credits.wav at Mega cloud thing
Credits.wav	246.4 MB
https://mega.nz/#!VnJAXTJb!piv_Qx_bX1ZvdlfDeEUdvBcmfOetYgOgpP51VX_UqLE 
NOTE: Music (C) to their own owners... Hopefully this could be fair use...

# Installation
It will be at https://stormregion.github.io

To get custom music open workshop\video and paste music file ("Credits.wav" there, must not be renamed!)
